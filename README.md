# ResearchKit

A systematic framework for conducting rigorous, multi-disciplinary research and extracting actionable frameworks.

---

## 🔬 What is ResearchKit?

ResearchKit helps researchers, consultants, and writers conduct systematic research that combines:
- **Rigorous methodology** (constitutional research principles)
- **Multi-disciplinary perspectives** (research streams)
- **Vivid storytelling** (narrative evidence library)
- **Actionable frameworks** (practitioner-ready insights)

Originally inspired by Spec-Driven Development principles, ResearchKit applies software engineering discipline to research workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Initialize ResearchKit

```bash
./researchkit/scripts/init-researchkit.sh
```

### Create Your First Project

```bash
./researchkit/scripts/new-project.sh "your-research-topic"
```

### Start Researching

```bash
/rk.constitution    # Define your research principles
/rk.question        # Refine your research question
/rk.identify-paths  # Explore research traditions
/rk.create-stream   # Start disciplinary research
/rk.capture-story   # Capture vivid stories
/rk.find-stories    # Query story library
```

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

### Constitutional Research
Like constitutional software development, ResearchKit operates on **immutable methodological principles** that ensure quality, rigor, and actionable outputs.

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
Complex questions require multiple disciplinary lenses. ResearchKit enforces examination through at least 3 different perspectives.

### Narrative Evidence
Abstract concepts become memorable when paired with vivid, character-driven stories. ResearchKit treats stories as first-class research artifacts.

### Practitioner Readiness
Research outputs must be actionable. ResearchKit applies practical relevance filters throughout the workflow.

## 📖 Research Workflow

```
Constitution → Question → Research Paths → Streams → Stories → Frameworks → Writing
```

1. **Constitution**: Define your methodological principles
2. **Question**: Refine broad questions into precise, answerable variants
3. **Research Paths**: Identify foundational texts and recent literature
4. **Streams**: Conduct multi-disciplinary research
5. **Stories**: Capture vivid narrative evidence
6. **Frameworks**: Extract actionable insights
7. **Writing**: Integrate evidence and narrative
