### Step 2: Download ResearchKit

Now that Claude Code is installed, let's get ResearchKit.

#### Option A: Using Git (Recommended)

**What is Git?** A tool for downloading and managing code. Don't worry - you just need one command!

1. **Check if Git is installed**
   - In your terminal, type: `git --version`
   - If you see a version number, Git is installed! Skip to step 3.
   - If you see "command not found," continue to step 2.

2. **Install Git** (if needed)
   - **Mac**: Type `git` and press Enter. A popup will ask to install - click "Install"
   - **Windows (WSL)**: Type `sudo apt-get install git` and press Enter
   - **Linux**: Type `sudo apt-get install git` and press Enter

3. **Download ResearchKit**
   - Copy this command: `git clone https://github.com/adamjdavidson/ResearchKit.git ~/ResearchKit`
   - Paste into your terminal and press Enter
   - You should see "Cloning into 'ResearchKit'..." - this means it's working!

4. **Verify Download**
   - Type: `ls ~/ResearchKit`
   - Press Enter
   - You should see files like README.md, LICENSE, etc.

#### Option B: Manual Download (If Git doesn't work)

1. Go to: https://github.com/adamjdavidson/ResearchKit
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder you'll remember (like your Documents folder)
5. Note the path to this folder - you'll need it!

---

### Step 2.5: Choose Installation Mode

ResearchKit offers two installation modes:

#### 🎯 Mode 1: Project-Based (Recommended for Beginners)

**How it works**: ResearchKit commands are available when working inside the `~/ResearchKit` directory.

**Setup**: No additional steps needed! You can start using commands immediately.

**Usage**:
```bash
cd ~/ResearchKit
claude
# Now use /rk.init and other commands
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple, no setup required
- ✅ Isolated and predictable
- ✅ Clear what's happening

**Cons**:
- ❌ Must work inside ResearchKit directory
- ❌ Can't initialize projects in arbitrary locations

---

#### 🌍 Mode 2: Global Installation (Recommended for Power Users)

**How it works**: ResearchKit commands are available from ANY directory on your system.

**Setup**: Run the installation script once.

##### Option A: Automated Installation (Easiest)

```bash
cd ~/ResearchKit
bash install-researchkit-global.sh
```

The script will:
- Create `~/.claude/commands/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Create symbolic links to all ResearchKit commands
- Verify installation
- Report how many commands are available

##### Option B: Manual Installation

If you want to understand what's happening or prefer manual control:

**Step 1: Create global commands directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
```
This creates a hidden folder in your home directory where Claude Code looks for globally available commands.

**Step 2: Create symbolic links**
```bash
ln -sf ~/ResearchKit/.claude/commands/rk.*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```
This creates symlinks (shortcuts) from the global directory to ResearchKit's command files. The `-sf` flags mean:
- `-s`: Create symbolic link (not a copy)
- `-f`: Force (overwrite if exists)

**Step 3: Verify installation**
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/rk.*.md
```
You should see 13 symlinks pointing to ResearchKit command files.

**Why symlinks?**
- Changes in ResearchKit automatically reflected globally
- No duplication of files
- Easy to update with `git pull`
- Simple to uninstall

**Usage**:
```bash
# From ANY directory:
cd ~/my-project
claude
# Now use /rk.init and other commands
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Commands available everywhere
- ✅ Initialize research projects anywhere
- ✅ More convenient workflow

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires one-time setup
- ❌ Slightly less obvious what's installed

##### Uninstalling Global Mode

If you want to remove global installation:

**Automated:**
```bash
bash ~/ResearchKit/uninstall-researchkit-global.sh
```

**Manual:**
```bash
rm ~/.claude/commands/rk.*.md
```

This only removes the symlinks. Your `~/ResearchKit` directory remains intact, and you can still use commands when working inside that directory.

---

### Step 2.6: Verify Installation

Test that ResearchKit is available:

```bash
# If using Project-Based mode:
cd ~/ResearchKit
claude

# If using Global mode:
cd ~  # or any directory
claude

# Then type:
/rk
```

You should see ResearchKit commands appear in the autocomplete list (rk.init, rk.constitution, etc.)

---

### Step 3: Start Your First Project

Now for the exciting part - starting your research!

#### Create a Folder for Your Research

1. **Decide what you're researching**
   - Example: "Corporate AI Adoption"
   - Example: "Organizational Culture Change"
   - Example: "Fortune 500 Leadership"

2. **Create a folder for it**
   - In terminal, type: `mkdir ~/My-Research-Topic`
   - (Replace "My-Research-Topic" with your actual topic, using hyphens instead of spaces)
   - Example: `mkdir ~/Corporate-AI-Adoption`

3. **Navigate to that folder**
   - Type: `cd ~/My-Research-Topic`
   - (Replace with your folder name)
   - Example: `cd ~/Corporate-AI-Adoption`

#### Initialize ResearchKit

1. **Start Claude Code**
   - Type: `claude`
   - Press Enter
   - You'll see Claude's greeting

2. **Initialize ResearchKit in this folder**
   - Type: `/rk.init`
   - Press Enter
   - Claude will ask for your project name and description
   - Answer the prompts
   - Claude creates a `.researchkit` folder with all the structure you need!

#### Start Researching!

Now you can use ResearchKit commands:

```
/rk.constitution    # Define your research principles (do this first!)
/rk.question        # Refine your research question
/rk.identify-paths  # Discover research traditions and literature
/rk.create-stream   # Start researching from a specific discipline
/rk.capture-story   # Capture vivid stories as you find them
```

## 📖 How It Works

### Research Workflow

```
Constitution → Question → Research Paths → Streams → Stories → Frameworks → Writing
```

1. **Constitution**: Define your methodological principles
   - Example: "Examine every topic from 3+ perspectives"
   - Example: "Every concept needs a vivid story"

2. **Question**: Refine broad questions into precise, answerable variants
   - Start: "How do companies change?"
   - Refined: "What cultural factors predict successful AI adoption in Fortune 500 companies?"

3. **Research Paths**: Identify foundational texts and recent literature
   - Find seminal works (the classics everyone cites)
   - Find recent reviews (what's new in last 3-5 years)
   - Assess practical relevance

4. **Streams**: Conduct multi-disciplinary research
   - Psychology stream: How do people respond?
   - Finance stream: How do CFOs value this?
   - Strategy stream: What organizational structures enable this?

5. **Stories**: Capture vivid narrative evidence
   - Not just concepts, but concrete examples
   - Rate vividness (1-10)
   - Tag by emotional tone
   - Track sources

6. **Frameworks**: Extract actionable insights
   - When to use / not use
   - Step-by-step application
   - Illustrated with stories

7. **Writing**: Combine evidence and narrative
   - Lead with story (hook)
   - Explain framework (clarity)
   - Apply to practice (actionable)

### Project Structure

When you run `/rk.init`, ResearchKit creates:

```
Your-Research-Folder/
└── .researchkit/                # All research files live here
    ├── constitution.md          # Your research principles
    ├── questions/               # Question evolution
    ├── research-paths/          # Literature and traditions
    ├── documents/               # PDFs and sources
    ├── stories/                 # Story library

---

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

### Constitutional Research
Like constitutional software development (from Spec Kit), ResearchKit operates on **immutable methodological principles** that ensure quality, rigor, and actionable outputs.

Your constitution might include principles like:
- Multi-perspective analysis (examine through at least 3 lenses)
- Evidence-based reasoning (all claims cited)
- Contradiction awareness (document tensions, don't hide them)
- Narrative evidence (concepts paired with vivid stories)

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
Complex questions can't be answered from one discipline. ResearchKit enforces examination through multiple lenses (minimum 3 perspectives).

### Narrative Evidence
Abstract concepts become memorable when paired with vivid, character-driven stories. ResearchKit treats stories as first-class research artifacts.

### Practitioner Readiness
Research outputs must be actionable. ResearchKit applies practical relevance filters throughout the workflow.

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Beginners

**Start simple**:
- Begin with `/rk.constitution` to define 3-5 core principles
- Use `/rk.question` to clarify what you're really asking
- Create 2-3 research streams maximum at first

**Don't stress about perfection**:
- Your question will evolve as you research (that's normal!)
- Your constitution can be amended (use semantic versioning)
- Not every concept needs a story immediately

**Use validation**:
- Run `/rk.validate` periodically to check quality
- Constitutional principles catch common mistakes
- Better to catch issues early

### For Advanced Users

**Leverage cross-stream synthesis**:
- Use `/rk.cross-stream` to find integration opportunities
- Multi-disciplinary insights are most valuable
- Document contradictions explicitly

**Build a story library**:
- Capture stories during research, not during writing
- Rate vividness honestly (8-10 = lead story candidates)
- Tag liberally - easier to filter later

**Framework extraction**:
- Start with one framework, refine through iteration
- Test with real scenarios
- Get feedback from potential users

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: ResearchKit itself is free (MIT License). You need a Claude Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise subscription ($20-200/month depending on tier).

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: `/rk.init` command not found
- **Solution**: Make sure you've started Claude (`claude` command) first, and that you're in a directory where you want to do research

**Problem**: Claude Code won't install
- **Solution**: Check that you have Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`). If not, install from https://nodejs.org/

**Problem**: Commands work but files aren't being created
- **Solution**: Check that `.researchkit/` folder exists. If not, `/rk.init` may not have completed successfully. Try again.

**Problem**: I can't find my research files
- **Solution**: They're in `.researchkit/` folder (the dot makes it hidden). To see hidden files on Mac: `Cmd + Shift + .` in Finder. On Windows: View → Show → Hidden items
