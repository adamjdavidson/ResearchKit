# Projects Directory

This directory is for your research projects if you choose to work inside the ResearchKit folder.

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/ResearchKit/projects
mkdir my-research-topic
cd my-research-topic
claude
/rk.init
```

## Note

This entire `projects/` directory is git-ignored, so your research work won't be committed to the ResearchKit repository.

**Best Practice**: Work outside the ResearchKit folder entirely (e.g., `~/my-research/`) to keep your research completely separate from the tool.

**Alternative**: Use this `projects/` directory if you prefer to keep everything organized in one location.
